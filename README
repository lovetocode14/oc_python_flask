Sample web app in Python Flask deployed with OpenShift using CRC (OpenShift Local). In app.py, in the app.run() command, host= '0.0.0.0' because it defaults to localhost, 
  which won't work with OpenShift containers, or probably any containers. The port is up to you, by default it is 5000, if you go with this and only  
  have 1 container running, it will default to 8080, which will cause issues. You can change that port in the Python code to 8000, or configure it in 
  build/deployment/route configs in OpenShift. 
  
  Also, it should be called app like in the app.py file, S2I looks for this, so without having to change too much in configs, just call your app this. 
  
Commands to get it running in CRC: 
  oc new-app <link-to-repo>        -- You will have to have a requirements.txt with your Python environment dependencies for OpenShift to run S2I
                                   -- through new-app
                                   -- An easy way to do this is while in your git repo, pip freeze > requirements.txt
 
 Some useful OC commands: 
  oc get builds
  oc get pods
  oc get services
  
Now just expose the service and you should be up and running. 

  oc expose <service-name>
